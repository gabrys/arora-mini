Arora-mini web browser

Arora-mini is a fork of Arora with some improvements meant for small Linux devices, such as mobile phones or PDAs. The goal of this project is to implement the following changes:

* simpler UI (means removing some functionality)
* smart zoom
 * at first you see page as you have 1024px-width screen
 * clicking on a page sets zooms to 100% and centers the screen where you clicked
 * clicking now activates links and other web content
 * you have "overview" button that shows you the thumbnail of the page again
* scroll by finger with (iPhone style) or without kinetics (AdobeReader style)
* optimization of creating WebKit widgets (always keep 4 of them ready or something similar, to boost "open in new tab")
* integration of userscripts.org and userstyles.org (this would be a way to modify some of the sites, to better match small device screen)
* BONUS FEATURE: configurable integration with minimizing proxy like RabbIT3 (make images smaller, gzip texts, keep connection to only one server, not to many)
* BONUS FEATURE: compile this statically with the newest and fastest Qt and distribute to www.opkg.org or similar sites for different devices.

Currently none from the list above is implemented.

When they are all done and the browser remains fast, we'll finally have a nice browser for X11/Linux based phones!

Arora web browser

Arora is a cross platform web browser built using Qt and WebKit.


Building:
Arora uses the qmake build system.  If you already have Qt 4.5 or newer on your system building is as easy as running the command 'qmake' and then 'make' or 'nmake' on Windows.
